The technology was first used in football in the UK in 2001 and has since been used in many other sports including cricket, tennis, rugby, basketball, and volleyball. Hawk Eye uses a network of high-speed cameras around the playing field to track the ball's trajectory. The system then uses computer algorithms to calculate the ball's likely path and provides a virtual replay for the umpire or referee to review to make their decision.</p>\n<p>Hawk Eye's accuracy is impressive, with the system calculating the ball's position to within 5mm. This accuracy is achieved by using multiple cameras to track the ball and by using triangulation methods to determine the ball's position. The cameras used in Hawk Eye are very sophisticated and are able to detect the ball's position even when it is obscured from view by players. As a result, Hawk Eye is able to provide accurate information to umpires and referees in real time, allowing them to make the correct decision quickly and accurately.</p>"
